> [!NOTE]  
> This is a **machine learning-powered real estate valuation tool** built in Rust. It uses **Elastic Net Regression** to predict property prices based on **historical data** from real estate listings. **As of v0.1.0-pre.alpha.1, Spain + Idealista API is the only country available for scraping.**

This AI model processes **location-based property features** (size, floor, amenities, etc.) to estimate real estate values. It includes **scraping, training, and prediction capabilities**.

## Features

> [!WARNING]  
> **This model is experimental.** It is not a financial advisory tool and should not be used for critical investment decisions.

- **Property Price Estimation** - Uses **Elastic Net Regression** to predict real estate prices.
- **Automated Data Scraping** - Fetches property data from Idealista.
- **Machine Learning Training** - Builds a model using historical property listings.
- **Feature Extraction** - Uses **location, size, rooms, bathrooms, and more** as predictive factors.
- **Evaluation Metrics** - Computes **RÂ² score** to assess model performance.

## In action

```shell
What do you want to do?: Predict Property Price
Enter the size (mÂ²) of the property: 196
Enter the floor number (leave empty if not applicable): 6
Enter the latitude: 32
Enter the longitude: 0.43
Does the property have a lift? yes
Enter price per mÂ² (if not known, leave empty): 3500
Number of bedrooms: 4
Number of bathrooms: 3
Does the property have a swimming pool? yes
Does the property have a garden? yes
Does the property have a garage? yes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (latest stable)
- **Cargo** package manager
- **CSV dataset** (automatically generated from scraper)

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NEBYTE/HouseValuation.git
cd HouseValuation
```

### Build the Project

```sh
cargo build --release
```

---

## Usage

### Scrape Data

```sh
cargo run --release
```

This will **scrape Idealista real estate listings** and save them to `data/idealista_homes_spain.csv`.

---

### Train the Model

```sh
cargo run --release
```

The model will process the dataset and generate a **trained Elastic Net Regression model** saved to `output/cervo_model.bin`.

---

### Predict Property Prices

To estimate the price of a custom property:

```sh
cargo run --release -- predict
```

It will prompt the user for property details (size, rooms, location, etc.) and return a **predicted price**.

---

## Technical Overview

### **Machine Learning Model**
- **Algorithm**: Elastic Net Regression
- **Input Features**:
    - **Geolocation** (latitude, longitude)
    - **Size** (square meters)
    - **Floor level**
    - **Number of rooms & bathrooms**
    - **Amenities** (pool, garden, garage, lift)
- **Evaluation Metric**: **RÂ² Score**

### **Dataset Handling**
- **CSV Format**
- **Auto-generated via scraper**
- **Stores property attributes & prices**

### **Risk & Error Handling**
- **Missing values handling**
- **Data normalization**
- **Cross-validation (K=5)**
